# Building OpenTS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Visual Studio 2022 Win32 Debug and Release builds are supported. Both have
> been verified from a fresh CMake configuration. A successful build
> establishes compilation, not runtime behavior.

## Supported target

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Host and architecture | Windows, 32-bit (`Win32`) target |
| Processor | SSE2, so a Pentium 4 or Athlon 64 onward |
| Generator and compiler | Visual Studio 2022 MSVC 19.30 or newer |
| Windows SDK | A Visual Studio-installed Windows SDK |
| CMake | 3.23 or newer |
| C++ language level | C++20 |
| Configurations | Debug and Release |

Other generators, compilers, architectures, and configurations are not
supported by the current tree.

Install Visual Studio 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload,
a Windows SDK, CMake 3.23 or newer, and Git for Windows.

## Configure and build

Run these commands from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32
cmake --build build --config Debug
cmake --build build --config Release
```

CMake normally discovers Visual Studio through the Visual Studio Installer. If
the installation is not registered, provide its installation directory and
product version through `CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`.

The generated solution exposes only Debug and Release. Successful builds write
the engine executable under `build/bin/<configuration>/` under its runtime
name and copy the runtime files into `TS_RUN_DIR`, which defaults to `Run/`:

| Configuration | Runtime files |
| --- | --- |
| Debug | `GameD.exe`, `GameD.pdb`, `GameD.map`, `Language.dll` |
| Release | `Game.exe`, `Game.pdb`, `Game.map`, `Language.dll` |

`Language.dll` has the same name in both configurations, so the most recently
built configuration replaces the previous copy in `Run/`. Compiler and linker
intermediates remain under the selected build directory.

## Verification boundary

The supported matrix was verified on August 16, 2026 with CMake 4.3.3, Visual
Studio 2022 Community 17.14.37328.6, MSVC 19.44.35228, and Windows SDK
10.0.26100. Fresh Win32 Debug and Release builds completed successfully. The
builds retain inherited MSVC warnings; warnings are not treated as errors, but
contributions should not add new warnings.

Build verification establishes that the supported toolchain compiles and links
the configured targets and produces the listed artifacts. Runtime behavior is
established separately, by play testing, and is outside this build-support
record.

The repository contains no maps, movies, audio, or other original game assets.
Keep legally obtained runtime data local and outside version control. Do not
commit populated run directories, original executables, proprietary SDKs, IDE
state, compiler output, generated CMake projects, or credentials.
