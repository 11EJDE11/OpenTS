A computer house does not weigh up what to build next. It works down a **base node list**: an ordered list in which each entry — a **node** — names one BuildingType and the cell that structure belongs on. Position in the list is the build order, and nothing else bears on it: there is no priority scoring, and the house always takes the first node it has not built yet.

Not every node names a structure at a place. A cell of `0,0` names no cell, and hands the spot to the placement search instead. And three of the values that would otherwise name a BuildingType are instructions to the planner: `-1` asks for a base defense whose type the planner chooses, `-2` stops the scan there, and `-3` runs the perimeter wall planner.

## Where the plan comes from

The list is carried in the house's own map section, not in a section of its own. [`NodeCount`](/keys/nodecount/) gives the entry count and entries are read in order from zero-padded three-digit keys; a value beginning with `-` is one of the three instructions, otherwise the first field is an ObjectType ID and the next two are the cell X and Y. Structures a scenario starts with are ordinary map objects, which the node list then matches.

```ini title="map file"
[GDI]
NodeCount=4
000=MYCONST,42,58 ; example construction yard BuildingType
001=MYWEAP,45,58  ; example war factory BuildingType
002=-1,0,0        ; base defense; the planner picks the type and the cell
003=MYPOWR,0,0    ; example power plant BuildingType; cell picked at build time
```

A house whose list is empty generates one when either of two things happens: an MCV of a non-human house deploys into a [`ConstructionYard=yes`](/keys/constructionyard/) BuildingType outside a campaign game, or a house passes to the computer. A scenario-supplied list suppresses generation entirely.

## Building the plan

1. **Candidates.** A BuildingType is a candidate while all of this holds:
   - its [`Owner`](/keys/owner/) includes this house;
   - it is [`AIBuildThis=yes`](/keys/aibuildthis/);
   - its [`TechLevel`](/keys/techlevel/) is within the house's scenario tech level;
   - it is not [`Weeder=yes`](/keys/weeder/), or the map carries a veinhole monster;
   - it is not the excluded plug — under the Firestorm addon one of the hard-coded IDs `GAPLUG2`, `GAPLUG3` and `GAPLUG4` is drawn at random and left out.
2. **Seed.** Entry 0 of [`BuildConst`](/keys/buildconst/), which must also pass that filter, then unconditionally the first [`BuildPower`](/keys/buildpower/) entry the house may own. The first ownable [`BuildBarracks`](/keys/buildbarracks/) entry moves to the head of the candidate list and the first ownable [`BuildWeapons`](/keys/buildweapons/) entry to second place.
3. **Expansion.** Repeated passes append every candidate whose [`Prerequisite`](/keys/prerequisite/) list the queue already satisfies, resolving a generic prerequisite through `BuildWeapons`, `BuildBarracks`, [`BuildRadar`](/keys/buildradar/) or [`BuildTech`](/keys/buildtech/) and treating the `BuildConst` construction yard as always satisfied. A [`Helipad=yes`](/keys/helipad/) type is appended one to three extra times; the hard-coded `GAPLUG` waits for a pass that adds nothing else.
4. **Refineries.** `2 - Difficulty` extra copies of the first ownable [`BuildRefinery`](/keys/buildrefinery/) entry, at random positions after the first refinery.
5. **Defenses.** A build cost running from the cost of queue entries 1 and 2 accumulates entry by entry, and before each entry the plan calls for `(cost - 2000) / 1500` defenses scaled by [`NodBaseDefenseCoefficient`](/keys/nodbasedefensecoefficient/) for a house named "Nod" and by [`GDIBaseDefenseCoefficient`](/keys/gdibasedefensecoefficient/) for every other house. Each unit of shortfall becomes a `-1` placeholder, preceded by a [`WallTower`](/keys/walltower/) node for GDI. When the house is Nod, or when [`AIBuildsWalls=no`](/keys/aibuildswalls/), further placeholders follow: `(3 - Difficulty) * 3` of them for a house named GDI, and `(3 - Difficulty) * 2` for every other house.
6. **Wall.** A `-3` node closes the list when `AIBuildsWalls=yes` and the house is either not Nod or has [`NodAIBuildsWalls=yes`](/keys/nodaibuildswalls/).

`Difficulty` in steps 4 and 5 is the house's own [difficulty slot](/systems/difficulty/#from-the-setting-to-a-slot) — `[Easy]` is 0, `[Normal]` 1 and `[Difficult]` 2 — and a computer house is handed the inverse of the setting the player chose. The table works both terms out for each setting. Read the two right-hand columns downward: the harder the player set the game, the more extra refineries the plan carries and the larger the placeholder counts in step 5 come out.

| Setting chosen | Slot the computer house holds | `2 - Difficulty`, the extra refineries | `3 - Difficulty`, the term in the placeholder counts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 2, the `[Difficult]` section | 0 | 1 |
| Normal | 1, the `[Normal]` section | 1 | 2 |
| Hard | 0, the `[Easy]` section | 2 | 3 |

The same `3 - Difficulty` term caps the [wall defenses](#walls-and-gates) a GDI house appends after its perimeter wall.

## Choosing what to build next

A house takes the first node not counted as built while all of this holds:

- it is not a human player's house;
- its country is not [`MultiplayPassive=yes`](/keys/multiplaypassive/);
- its production mode allows structure work;
- it has no structure already committed;
- it owns a construction yard.

A node counts as built under any of these:

- a building of the node's own type, owned by this house, stands on the node's cell;
- the node names a wall type and its cell carries that wall's overlay;
- the node names a wall type and its cell carries any building.

A node whose cell is `0,0` never counts as built. A `-3` node deletes itself before running the wall planner, and a `-1` node or a cell-less `WallTower` node is deleted when the defense planner fails on it, taking the following node with it when it is a wall tower. Any other node becomes the house's pending structure. Because the first unbuilt node is always the one taken, a node no owned factory can produce holds up every node behind it.

## Choosing a spot

Placement is resolved when the finished structure leaves the construction yard. A real cell on the matching node is used when the type is an upgrade or the compactness test accepts that cell, and otherwise a search runs and writes its result back into the node.

Placing any structure flags its footprint, expanded by [`AIBaseSpacing`](/keys/aibasespacing/) on all sides, as occupied by its house and grows that house's base rectangle to contain it. The search ranks the frontier of that area — cells with at least one, but not all eight, occupied neighbors — nearest the base center for an ordinary structure and thinnest in existing defense coverage for a base defense, then steps outward from each ranked cell away from the mass of the base, clear of the structure's own footprint plus `AIBaseSpacing`. A step is accepted while all of this holds:

- the step's footprint rectangle, grown by that spacing, holds no cell this house already occupies;
- that same rectangle lies inside the playable area;
- every cell of the structure's own foundation is clear to build on, except that a type laying its own tile underneath itself needs only one clear cell;
- the ground height at the step is within 2 of the height under the base center;
- the compactness test accepts the step.

The first two terms are settled together as one test, and that test is skipped altogether on a second pass over the ranked cells, so a cramped base still builds. A search that accepts nothing returns cell `0,0`.

That compactness test passes unconditionally in a campaign game, so campaign bases spread wherever the other tests allow. Every other session type requires an already-occupied cell within the candidate footprint padded by `AIBaseSpacing` — one cell beyond that margin to the north and west, and twice the spacing plus one to the south and east — welding a skirmish or multiplayer base to what it holds.

An allied ground object standing in the placement zone is ordered to move and the factory waits [`PlacementDelay`](/keys/placementdelay/) minutes. A permanent obstruction — an overlay, a terrain object, a building that cannot take the structure as an upgrade, or another house's object — and a failed placement both abandon the structure: the factory refunds the cost already paid, deletes the object under construction, and clears the pending structure. The node is deleted when its type is a wall or a gate, and otherwise every node claiming that cell has its cell reset to `0,0`. After a `WallTower` is placed, the next base-defense node moves onto the tower's cell.

:::caution[The computer does not run the adjacency proximity check]
[`Adjacent`](/keys/adjacent/) and [`BaseNormal`](/keys/basenormal/) govern player-controlled placement only. The computer's search tests foundation cells, height difference, its own reservation footprint and the compactness test, and never consults [base adjacency](/systems/base-adjacency/). Raising `Adjacent` does not loosen a computer base, and `BaseNormal=no` does not stop the computer building beside a structure.

## Base defenses

The planner is handed a list of cells the base is expected to be attacked through: each one is a **threat cell**, and the list as a whole is the house's **threat ring**. Exactly one thing ever fills it — [the perimeter wall planner](#walls-and-gates) records the wall cells it laid, and only for a house named GDI — so every other house reaches the defense planner with no threat ring at all. The qualifications below all turn on which of those two cases applies.

A defense node is filled in against the quadrant of the base that needs it most. Each owned building's anti-air, anti-armor and anti-infantry values are summed per quadrant and stamped into three per-cell coverage maps out to radius 6, falling off as `value / ((distance - 1) * 0.1 + 1)`, and the lowest-total quadrant wins — restricted, where a threat ring was supplied, to the quadrants holding at least one of its cells. The category is the one least represented in that quadrant — ties resolve to anti-infantry first, then anti-armor over anti-air — because the predicted enemy composition it is measured against is a fixed 0.33 in each of the three.

A BuildingType is a candidate for that category while all of this holds:

- the house may own it;
- its value in that category is above zero;
- its `TechLevel` is within the house's reach;
- its prerequisites are met by the non-defense buildings the house owns, plus `WallTower` for GDI.

An empty list falls back to anti-armor, then anti-infantry, then anti-air, and all three empty deletes the node. One candidate is drawn at random, weighted by `10000 / cost + its value in that category`, so cheap defenses dominate. It consumes the best-scoring cell of the threat ring where one was supplied, and takes the placement search's result otherwise.

What the node then receives depends on which kind of node it is. A `-1` placeholder takes both the chosen type and the chosen cell. A `WallTower` node keeps its own type and takes only the cell, and the chosen defense is written into the node after it at that same cell — but only while that following node is still a `-1` placeholder. In that case a wall node already claiming the cell is deleted as well, and only when a threat ring was supplied.

A BuildingType's three category values are computed from rules once the weapons are loaded, and only for a type with [`IsBaseDefense=yes`](/keys/isbasedefense/). From its primary weapon, `damage` is `Damage / (ROF * 0.025)` truncated to a whole number. An anti-aircraft projectile sets `AntiAirValue` to `damage` multiplied by the warhead's [`Verses`](/keys/verses/) percentage against `heavy` armor; an anti-ground projectile sets `AntiArmorValue` from that same `heavy` figure and `AntiInfantryValue` from the `Verses` percentage against `none`. All three are capped at [`MaximumBaseDefenseValue`](/keys/maximumbasedefensevalue/). A type without `IsBaseDefense=yes`, or with no primary weapon, keeps all three at zero and never enters a candidate list; at runtime a building whose own value is zero reports the first non-zero value among its plugged-in upgrades instead.

## Walls and gates

The wall ring is the base rectangle grown by one cell on each side, walked along its four edges. A cell takes a wall while all of this holds:

- its height is within 2 of the height under the base center;
- neither it nor its outward neighbor is rock, water or ice;
- it carries no overlay;
- neither it nor its outward neighbor holds a building;
- neither it nor its outward neighbor holds a terrain object;
- its ramp is flat;
- it lies inside the playable area.

A run becomes wall nodes once it reaches five cells, or sooner when an overlay or a ramp cuts it short.

Wall nodes come from the first ownable [`ConcreteWalls`](/keys/concretewalls/) entry and are all appended before any gate node. Gate nodes — [`EWGates`](/keys/ewgates/) on the north and south edges, [`NSGates`](/keys/nsgates/) on the east and west — take the midpoint of a run and consume three wall slots each; a run cut short by an overlay or a ramp is laid as plain wall. For GDI the wall cells also become the [threat ring](#base-defenses) the defense planner draws from, and pairs of a `WallTower` node and a `-1` node are appended, `0.2` per wall node and capped at `(3 - Difficulty) * `[`GDIWallDefenseCoefficient`](/keys/gdiwalldefensecoefficient/)` + `[`GDIWallDefense`](/keys/gdiwalldefense/). The base rectangle then becomes the wall ring, so the next wall is planned one ring further out.

:::caution[Side behavior keys off the house's country name]
The planner compares the house's country name against the literal strings "GDI" and "NOD", case-insensitively. A house named neither takes the GDI defense coefficient, receives no wall towers and no threat ring — leaving that branch of the defense planner unreachable for it — and answers power shortages with Nod's power plants.
:::

## Power and money interventions

A power plant node is inserted immediately before the node the house is about to build while all of this holds:

- the session is not a campaign game;
- the node's own drain added to the house's current drain exceeds its current power output;
- the node is not the [`BuildConst`](/keys/buildconst/) construction yard;
- the node's type draws power at all.

Which plant goes in depends on the house. GDI inserts [`GDIPowerTurbine`](/keys/gdipowerturbine/) when it owns a [`GDIPowerPlant`](/keys/gdipowerplant/) with a free upgrade slot and a random draw falls under [`AIUseTurbineUpgradeProbability`](/keys/aiuseturbineupgradeprobability/) — a fraction of 1 that defaults to 1, so the turbine is taken whenever a slot is free unless the value is lowered — and `GDIPowerPlant` otherwise; every other house inserts [`NodAdvancedPower`](/keys/nodadvancedpower/) when the buildings it owns meet that type's prerequisites, and [`NodRegularPower`](/keys/nodregularpower/) otherwise.

A house that cannot make money, again only outside campaign games, sells its base from the back of the node list forward until the proceeds cover a harvester — where it owns both a refinery and a war factory — or a refinery otherwise, abandons its factories, and either orders that harvester or inserts a refinery node at the current build position. Selling out the whole list without raising enough sends every unit it owns to hunt.

## Rebuilding

Rebuilding needs no separate mechanism: a destroyed structure stops matching its node, and the node becomes the next hole in the list. When a building is taken off the map, every other node claiming its cell has its cell cleared, and outside campaign games an `IsBaseDefense=yes` node is retired to a `-1` placeholder so the planner picks a fresh type and cell for it.

## Parsed settings without effect

`[AI]` carries a block of ratio and limit settings that no decision reads: [`RefineryRatio`](/keys/refineryratio/), [`RefineryLimit`](/keys/refinerylimit/), [`BarracksRatio`](/keys/barracksratio/), [`BarracksLimit`](/keys/barrackslimit/), [`WarRatio`](/keys/warratio/), [`WarLimit`](/keys/warlimit/), [`DefenseRatio`](/keys/defenseratio/), [`DefenseLimit`](/keys/defenselimit/), [`AARatio`](/keys/aaratio/), [`AALimit`](/keys/aalimit/), [`TeslaRatio`](/keys/teslaratio/), [`TeslaLimit`](/keys/teslalimit/), [`HelipadRatio`](/keys/helipadratio/), [`HelipadLimit`](/keys/helipadlimit/), [`AirstripRatio`](/keys/airstripratio/), [`AirstripLimit`](/keys/airstriplimit/), [`BaseSizeAdd`](/keys/basesizeadd/), [`InfantryReserve`](/keys/infantryreserve/), [`InfantryBaseMult`](/keys/infantrybasemult/) and [`PowerEmergency`](/keys/poweremergency/). The type lists [`BuildDefense`](/keys/builddefense/), [`BuildPDefense`](/keys/buildpdefense/), [`BuildAA`](/keys/buildaa/) and [`BuildHelipad`](/keys/buildhelipad/) are parsed but never consulted; base defenses come from the computed values above, not from a list. [`PowerSurplus`](/keys/powersurplus/) is parsed into the rules but never reaches a house, whose own power margin stays at zero, so the power interjection fires on the first shortfall rather than on a configured cushion. [`PercentBuilt`](/keys/percentbuilt/) in a house's map section is read and written back unchanged and controls nothing.
